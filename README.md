Scripts to decompose EEG signals from the Bonn University datbase , according to three methods: Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD),
Empirical Wavelet Transform (EWT) and Variational Mode Decomposition. EEG data should be dowloaded (from http://epileptologie-bonn.de/cms/front_content.php?idcat=193&lang=3&changelang=3) to the folder "database".  

"main_feats.py" opens and decomposes each EEG into N modes (with EMD, VMD and EWT). Features from each mode are then extracted and written in .csv files.  

"main_classify.pu" opens .csv files with features generated by "main_feats.py". Samples are split into training/testing sets into 5-folds for cross-validation. Several classifiers are evaluated and mean performance results are presented for 10 iterations.

The following packages are required: numpy, scipy, scikit-learn, pandas, matplotlib, EMD-signal, ewtpy, vmdpy.
